# starter express app template

* node with babel
* expressjs
* airbnb eslint rules

Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)

# What worked?
	Full functionality. A react-redux blog website connecting with a back end mongo server on a heroku app. I had issues installing dependencies. Dependencies have to be rebuilt using 'yar' if a new package is installed.

# What didn't work?
	Adding comments didn't work. It requres a separate model.

# Extra credit
	tags as arrays
