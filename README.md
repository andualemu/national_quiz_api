# starter express app template

* node with babel
* expressjs
* mongodb
* airbnb eslint rules

Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)

# What worked?
	Full functionality. A react-redux blog website connecting with a back end mongo server on a heroku app. With own backend
	I had issues installing dependencies. Dependencies have to be rebuilt using 'yar' if a new package is installed.

# What didn't work?
	Adding comments didn't work. It requres a separate model.

# Extra credit
	More pages and content: Profile page
	Redux error handeling: Error handling with store, actions, and reducers
	Permission system: Permissions so that users can only edit or delete their own posts.
